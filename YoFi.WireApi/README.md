# YoFi.WireApi

This YoFi layer provides thin controllers which expose APIs for each YoFi.Core UI-facing interface.

Ideally, these controllers are so thin they could be generated.

This produces an OpenAPI specification which can be used to create a Client SDK.

## openapi.json

Note that the openapi.json file here is generated by building YoFi.WireApi.Host. 
The NSwag toolchain requires a running web host to generate the specification.
